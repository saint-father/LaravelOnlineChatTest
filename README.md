# LaravelOnlineChatTest
 I use the Ratchet library for client-server communication, Bootstrap for styling the interface and EmberJS for connecting the server-side code and user interface together.
#
 Please user "php artisan chat:serve" from application directory for starting the Chat server. 
 "Listening on port 8080." message will appear.
#
Additionally, I use Ember JS library as client-side ORM pattern.
